# SAMD21-Breakout-Board
A breakout board for the SAMD21, better known as the M0+. All pins are broken out with the additon of USB and LiPo charging hardware

This breakout board combines both the Adafruit M0 Feather and the Sparkfun board. From the Adafruit board comes Lipo charging, and from the Sparkfun board comes the full breakout. The header pins for SWO programming are broken out, and a microUSB interface is provided just in case you do compile your own bootloader.
